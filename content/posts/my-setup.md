<h3>Introduction</h3>
This post will be my documentation, and hopefully a changelog of my (current) setup. Why do I need this post? Because I forget how to setup that and this. I don't want to google like crazy in times of trouble. I am also trying to make my setup well-documented such that I can setup everything from scratch without significant hassles.

TLDR;

Here is my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/hammashamzah/.dotfiles).
<h3>Changelog:</h3>
07 Dec 2017 - First Post
<h3>Notebook Setup</h3>
I am using Thinkpad T470 with Ubuntu 16.04 Installed. It was shipped with pre-installed Windows 10, but I (carelessly) deleted it because I thought I won't need that in the future. And now I'm considering to install Windows 10 as my secondary OS for image and video editing.
<h6>Window Manager</h6>
I am using i3wm with polybar. The configuration files are in my [dotfiles](https://hammashamzah.com) This is what I see first after starting up:

You can see many screenshots of my current setup [here](https://imgur.com/a/OsNSE).
<h6>Terminal</h6>
I'm using the standard gnome-terminal emulator with zsh with many configurations that I don't remember exactly (This is why I made this post, I will update it soon).
